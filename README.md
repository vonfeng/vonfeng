## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am [Jie Feng](https://vonfeng.github.io/), currently a postdoc at the Department of Electronics Engineering at Tsinghua University and work in [FIB Lab](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on LLMs, VLMs, and their applications in spatiotemporal data mining and urban science.
- ðŸŒ± You can find my full publication via [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uvLx-GAAAAAJ). Some of my proudest recent works:
  - [CityGPT](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityGPT): empowering urban spatial cognition of large language models.
  - [CityBench](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityBench): the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs and VLMs for diverse urban tasks.
  - [AgentMove](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentMove): the first agentic framwork for zero-shot mobility prediction.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaboration opportunities
  - Topics: Spatiotemporal data mining, large language models, embodied agent, etc.
  - Location: Remote or on-site at Tsinghua University
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to drop me an [email](fengj12ee@hotmail.com) for:
  * Any form of collaboration
  * Any issue about my works or code
  * Interesting ideas to discuss or just chatting
