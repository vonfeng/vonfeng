## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am [Jie Feng](https://vonfeng.github.io/), currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, working in [FIB Lab](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on **spatial intelligence**, **multi-modal LLMs**, **language agents**, and **urban science**.
- ðŸŒ± You can find my full publication via [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uvLx-GAAAAAJ). Some of my proudest works:
  - [CityGPT[KDD2025]](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityGPT): a framework for empowering urban spatial cognition of general LLMs through data synthesis and self-weighted tuning.
  - [CityBench[KDD2025]](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityBench): the first simulation-based evaluation benchmark for systematically evaluating the capabilities of LLMs and VLMs in diverse urban tasks.
  - [AgentMove[NAACL2025]](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentMove): the first LLM-based agentic framework for zero-shot human mobility prediction around the world.
  - [DeepMove[WWW2018]](https://github.com/vonfeng/DeepMove): a well-known attention based model for human mobility modeling.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaboration opportunities
  - Topics: spatial intelligence, spatiotemporal data mining, large language models, embodied agent, etc.
  - Location: Remote or on-site at Tsinghua University
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to drop me an [email](fengj12ee@hotmail.com) for:
  * Any form of collaboration
  * Any issue about my works or code
  * Interesting ideas to discuss or just chatting
