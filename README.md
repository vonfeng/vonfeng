## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am [Jie Feng](https://vonfeng.github.io/), currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, working in [FIB Lab](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently focused on **spatial intelligence**, **multi-modal LLMs**, **language agents**, and **urban science**.
- ðŸŒ± You can find my full publication via [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uvLx-GAAAAAJ). Some of my proudest works:
  - [UrbanLLaVA[ICCV2025]](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UrbanLLaVA): a multimodal large language model for urban intelligence, integrating various urban data. 
  - [CityGPT[KDD2025]](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityGPT): empowering urban spatial cognition of LLMs through data synthesis and self-weighted tuning.
  - [CityBench[KDD2025]](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityBench): simulation-based evaluation benchmark for evaluating LLMs and VLMs in diverse urban tasks.
  - [AgentMove[NAACL2025]](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentMove): LLM-based agentic framework for zero-shot human mobility prediction around the world.
  - [DeepMove[WWW2018]](https://github.com/vonfeng/DeepMove): a well-known attention-based model for human mobility modeling, cited over 800 times.
- ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m looking for collaboration opportunities
  - Topics: spatial intelligence, spatiotemporal data mining, large language models, embodied agent, etc.
  - Location: Remote or on-site at Tsinghua University
